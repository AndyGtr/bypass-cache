1. To use this option install a credential helper. Download git-credential-winstore.exe to the git/bin path and execute.

2. 'git help -a | grep credential-' from the resulting list find the helper

3. 'git help credential-foo'

4. If we want a password for https://example.com/foo.git Type:

'protocol=https'

'host=example.com'

'path=foo.git'

'username=bob'

'password=123'

5. Make edits, add, commit and push as normal (no repetative username/password entry required)
